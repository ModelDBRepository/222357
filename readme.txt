The basic instructions for analyzing simulation results are to first
set the input type in load_type_of_net_B_S.m so that the light stimulus
setting on either the primary glomerulus (light1) or on a secondary
glomerulus (light2) is indicated properly.  Then run
batch_make_tanks
batch_make_bipolars
(also the absolute paths need to be set to point to the simulation results folders).
